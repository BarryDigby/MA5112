# Week 1

In this weeks tutorial you are tasked with installing `FastQC` & `MultiQC` quality control tools to assess the quality of sequencing data provided under `week1/data`.

Following quality control assessment, install `TrimGalore!` to perform adapter trimming and low quality read filtering. You will re-run `FastQC` and `MultiQC` to check if the adapter trimming was successful.

## Git housekeeping

Make a clone of the GitHub repository `BarryDigby/MA5112` locally on your laptop:

```console
git clone git clone git@github.com:BarryDigby/MA5112.git
```
